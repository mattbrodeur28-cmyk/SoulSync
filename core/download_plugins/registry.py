"""Plugin registry — single source of truth for which download
sources exist, what their canonical names are, and which client
class implements each.

Replaces the orchestrator's hardcoded ``[self.soulseek,
self.youtube, self.tidal, ...]`` lists and ``source_map`` dicts
that historically had to be touched in 6+ places to add a source.
With the registry:

- One ``register()`` call adds a source to every dispatch path.
- Iteration helpers replace hand-maintained lists.
- The orchestrator stays oblivious to source-specific quirks.
- Adding Usenet (planned) becomes a one-line registry entry plus
  the new client class — no orchestrator changes.

This is the foundation step. Subsequent commits move shared logic
(thread workers, search query normalization, post-processing
context building) out of the orchestrator and the per-source
clients into helpers the registry exposes.

# factories lazy-import would cause tidalapi-dependent code to bind to
# whichever ``tidalapi`` object happens to be in ``sys.modules`` at the
# moment ``DownloadOrchestrator()`` is constructed — which is later
# than the legacy module-top imports here. Importing everything at
# registry-load time pins the bindings the same way the legacy
# orchestrator did.
